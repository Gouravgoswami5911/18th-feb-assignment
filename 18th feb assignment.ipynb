    "\n",
    "For example, if you use a weather app on your smartphone, the app might use an API to retrieve weather data from a weather \n",

    "various formats, including JSON and XML. RESTful architecture emphasizes the use of uniform resource identifiers (URIs) to \n",
    "identify and locate resources, making it easy to create scalable, decoupled systems.\n",
    "\n",

    "service provider and consumer agree on a WSDL (Web Services Description Language) contract that specifies the message formats \n",
    "and protocols used to communicate. SOAP also uses the XML schema definition (XSD) to define the structure of the messages.\n",
    "\n",
    "Shortcomings of SOAP Architecture:\n",
    "\n",
    "Complexity: SOAP architecture can be complex and difficult to implement due to its extensive use of XML messaging and WSDL \n",
